## Function 1: Swap Case of Each Character

This function accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

## Function 2:Generate Array Between Two Numbers

This JavaScript function accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

## Function 3: Filter Prime Numbers from an Array

TThis function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. It efficiently identifies prime numbers and maintains their order in the input array. 
For example, if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], it will return [2, 3, 5, 7].
